# Pico-Clone by Mert Kalkancı
A Type-C using Raspberry Pi Pİco Clone, my fist big schematic &amp; pcb in Eagle Student Edition.
Hope you like it, it may can have some wrong connections I didn't printed & tested it also do not use this in a production, you can find better clones on the web.

It take around 5 hours to make, to contact me reach my profile.
